# Chaitali Dikholkar - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
-  Hi, Iâ€™m @ChaitaliDikholkar, I have developed a strong foundation in the computer sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. 
- Iâ€™m interested in bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst. During my studies, I honed my
  ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data cleansing, stastical programming,
  SQL and R programming, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.n my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a well known organization, to upskill myself. Where, I get a full opportunity to learn more about data analytics, collaborate with co-workers and work on more challenging projects.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing Ride share data (for year 2019-2020 Q1) (https://github.com/ChaitaliDikholkar/Chaitali-The-Analyst/blob/main/2019-20Q1_ridedata_analysis.R)
**Code:** [`Analyzing Ride share data (for year 2019-2020 Q1)`](https://github.com/ChaitaliDikholkar/Chaitali-The-Analyst/blob/main/2019-20Q1_ridedata_analysis.R)

**Goal:** To determine how casual users and member differ.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of Cyclistic Bike Share Company between 2019 and 2020. The dataset included ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, member_casual and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between user type and ride duration, and implemented correlation statistical analysis using ggplot and ggplot2 R packages with tidyverse, tidyr and lubridate library's.

**Skills:** data cleaning, ETL process, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization, correlation analysis, dashboard designing.

**Technology:** R, tidyverse, tidyr, ggplot, ggplot2, ggvis, lubridate.

**Results:** Using R functions the analysis revealed that user type and ride duration, during week days have the highest correlation with gross earnings. Casual users are long time riders [with max time 89820] and member users and short time riders [with max time 89880]

### Divvy 2024 Bike Share Analysis
**Code:** [`Analyzing Ride share data (for year 2024 Q1 Q2)`](https://github.com/ChaitaliDikholkar/data_analyssi_portfolio/blob/main/2024_divvy_bikeshare_analysis.R)

**Goal:** To determine how casual users and member differ as will as how biketype used prefered by both users.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of Cyclistic Bike Share Company between 2024 (january to june). The dataset included ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, member_casual and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between user type and ride duration, and implemented correlation statistical analysis using ggplot and ggplot2 R packages with tidyverse, tidyr and lubridate library's.

**Skills:** data cleaning, ETL process, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization, correlation analysis, dashboard designing, story telling, R-markdown.

**Technology:** R, tidyverse, tidyr, ggplot, ggplot2, ggvis, lubridate.

**Results:** Using R functions the analysis revealed that user type and ride duration, during week days have the highest correlation with gross earnings. Both user type shows correlation with classic bike type with all day's high preference.
